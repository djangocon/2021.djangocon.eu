DESCRIPTION:Domain driven design is starting getting traction in the Python
  world\, probably also thanks to Architecture Patterns with Python (https:
 //www.cosmicpython.com/). \n\n\nIn this talk we will learn some basics of 
 Domain Driven Design and how to apply the pattern when using Django and Gr
 aphQL. We will see different approaches of modelling the domain\, and disc
 uss the tradeoffs. We will discuss why this approach makes a lot of sense 
 with GraphQL and finally we will see a complex approach where we leverage 
 the domain driven architecture to have an easy way to abstract how we stor
 e and cache our data in order to build a performant GraphQL API.
