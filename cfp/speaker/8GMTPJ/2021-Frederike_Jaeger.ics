DESCRIPTION:Imagine you built a pretty snazzy Django app to transform your 
 company's business. You're helping with revolutionising the energy industr
 y to make better use of green energy. Pretty cool right? Now imagine your 
 company is expanding to new countries and not only that\, other companies 
 want to use your app too. Even better! But also imagine you wrote that app
  specifcally with your company in one country in mind. This talk is going 
 to cover the approach we've taken in transforming our app to work for mult
 iple clients in multiple countries while still keeping the core of it the 
 same.
