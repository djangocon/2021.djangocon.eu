DESCRIPTION:There are some challenges that come up in every Django project.
  Some of them right at the start:  How do I organize my apps?  Where do I 
 put the base template\, and all the other templates? Should I do internati
 onalization right away?\nOther problems only crop up a little later: how d
 o I manage production settings? How do I make sure permissions are checked
  correctly? How do I make menus appear correctly?  \nSome may appear at an
 y point in time: how do I add content pages? What code goes into models/co
 ntrollers/views?\n\nIn this workshop\, I'm going to tell you how I approac
 h these recurring challenges and what my "best practices" in these situati
 ons are.
