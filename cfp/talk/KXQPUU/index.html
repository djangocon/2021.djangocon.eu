    <meta name="description" content="Building a modern web app requires *so much*: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, SQL, React, Bootstrap, Webpack...and Django, of course ;). What if we could build a better abstraction?

Our answer is Anvil: a full-stack Python environment where everything is a Python object, from your UI components to your database rows. In this talk, I&#39;ll walk you through how and why we constructed this new approach to the web.

We&#39;ll start with a question: Why is web programming hard? It&#39;s because your data takes so many forms: database rows, Python objects, JSON on REST, JS objects, HTML DOM, and finally pixels. Most of a web developer&#39;s job is translating between these awkwardly different  representations. Frameworks like Django help, but now you have a stack of leaky abstractions: web frameworks, ORMs, JS frameworks, CSS frameworks, build tools... These frameworks help you go faster, but they double the amount you need to know!

So I&#39;ll show our stab at an answer: A framework where everything is a Python object, requests to the server are function calls, and Python is a browser-side language. I&#39;ll talk about running Python in the browser. I&#39;ll talk about full-stack autocompletion. There will even be live coding.

And then I&#39;ll talk about how it breaks. Because every abstraction breaks, and this abstraction is bigger than most. So I&#39;ll touch on what it means to go down with the ship, to use an ejector seat, or to open an escape hatch.

Join me for a rollicking tour of a new way to approach the web!
