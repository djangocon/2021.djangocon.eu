DESCRIPTION:As programmers\, we’re very lucky - our work is often creativ
 e and enjoyable\, and the culture of programming itself is inventive and p
 layful. Programming can be a pleasure in itself. What we don’t usually r
 ecognise is that the effect of this is to make the software we create wors
 e rather better. If we want to make better software\, we need to start pro
 gramming not for pleasure\, but for pain.
