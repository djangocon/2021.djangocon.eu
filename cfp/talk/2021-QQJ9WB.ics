DESCRIPTION:You're probably asking yourself "Why would someone wanna do tha
 t?". Django is one of the most successful web frameworks out there\, the c
 odebase is well established and well tested.\n\nThat is true. On the other
  hand\, a codebase that old is bond to have some technical debt.\nIMHO\, D
 jango's technical debt is mostly situated in the admin which is one of the
  most appreciated features of Django while at the same time\, possessing t
 he least people familiar with its internals or willing to learn them.\nAno
 ther sort of technical debt is one that is backward compatibility and havi
 ng to keep choices made more than a decade ago.
