DESCRIPTION:Django's ORM is full-featured\,  simple to use\, and  well-suit
 ed for almost all interactions with your database. But sometimes\, to get 
 better performance or to get data in just the format that you need\, it is
  useful to have the full expressiveness of SQL in your Django application.
 \n\nIn this talk\, we will look at using SQL with Django. We will see in w
 hich situations the use of SQL makes most sense. You will see the power of
  SQL and the best ways to use SQL with Django.\n\nWe will start with a sho
 rt review of SQL and of use cases for which SQL gives you more fine-graine
 d control and better results than Djangos ORM. Then\, we look at raw SQL q
 ueries and RawQuerySets. RawQuerySets make it possible to get model instan
 ces with custom SQL. Finally\, we learn how to directly work with Django S
 QL connections and use SQL change your data or get results that don't fit 
 any particular model instance.
