    <title>The request/response cycle - a Djangonautic journey ::  DjangoCon Europe 2021 :: pretalx</title>
    <meta name="title" content="The request/response cycle - a Djangonautic journey  - DjangoCon Europe 2021 pretalx">
    <meta name="description" content="How exactly do web-servers communicate with Django? and what happens immediately after that? If you&#39;ve ever wondered where the `request` object comes from? How the middleware-chain is put together? Or just what all those functions you see in your exception tracebacks do? Then join me in a deep dive of everything between the server, the view and back again, as we answer these questions and more. 

This talk will be a look under the hood at Django&#39;s request handlers, middleware-chain and URL-resolvers. Focusing on just the WSGI route (not asynchronous), it aims to be accessible to beginners, but with the intention that a more experienced user will learn something new or interesting as well. 

We will start off by replacing Django&#39;s `WSGIHandler` with our own &quot;hello world&quot; WSGI application. We&#39;ll then build back in additional features until it starts to resemble what we originally had. Along the way, we&#39;ll highlight lesser-known features, and give examples demonstrating how understanding the implementation will enable you to better take advantage of the features Django offers, and ultimately write better code.
