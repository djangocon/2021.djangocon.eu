    <meta name="description" content="Does building your real time chat with Django sound fun to you? Let’s get some help from Django Channels in order to do so. In this talk I’d like to illustrate how we can use Django Channels for various purposes by showcasing its concepts and diverse use cases.

This talk will cover beginner topics around Django Channels and will teach attendees the basics in order to build a simple real time chat using the library.

This talk is mainly directed at beginners who are interested in learning more about Django Channels. It is expected that attendees have basic knowledge of Django (or at least Python). 

Some of the takeaways attendees are expected to have acquired by the end of the talk:

- What is Django Channels and how does it work?
- Main concepts for basic usage
- How we can use the library to build cool stuff such as a real time chat
