DESCRIPTION:As programmers\, we’re very lucky - our work is often creativ
 e and enjoyable\, and the culture of programming itself is inventive and p
 layful. Programming can be a pleasure in itself. What we don’t usually r
 ecognise is that the effect of this is to make the software we create wors
 e rather better. If we want to make better software\, we need to start pro
 gramming not for pleasure\, but for pain.

DESCRIPTION:Django's ORM is full-featured\,  simple to use\, and  well-suit
 ed for almost all interactions with your database. But sometimes\, to get 
 better performance or to get data in just the format that you need\, it is
  useful to have the full expressiveness of SQL in your Django application.
 \n\nIn this talk\, we will look at using SQL with Django. We will see in w
 hich situations the use of SQL makes most sense. You will see the power of
  SQL and the best ways to use SQL with Django.\n\nWe will start with a sho
 rt review of SQL and of use cases for which SQL gives you more fine-graine
 d control and better results than Djangos ORM. Then\, we look at raw SQL q
 ueries and RawQuerySets. RawQuerySets make it possible to get model instan
 ces with custom SQL. Finally\, we learn how to directly work with Django S
 QL connections and use SQL change your data or get results that don't fit 
 any particular model instance.

 Domain Driven Design and how to apply the pattern when using Django and Gr
 aphQL. We will see different approaches of modelling the domain\, and disc
 uss the tradeoffs. We will discuss why this approach makes a lot of sense 
 with GraphQL and finally we will see a complex approach where we leverage 
 the domain driven architecture to have an easy way to abstract how we stor
 e and cache our data in order to build a performant GraphQL API.

DESCRIPTION:Cleanroom software engineering process is a software developmen
 t process developed at IBM intended to produce software with a certifiable
  level of reliability.  A principal objective of the Cleanroom process is 
 development of software that exhibits zero failures in use. In this worksh

DESCRIPTION:Load testing is critical in the software development lifecycle 
 as it evaluates application performance affected by normal and peak loads 
 by simulating access and usage by multiple users concurrently. \n\nLocustI
 O\, an open source tool written in python\, is used for load testing of we
 b applications. It is simple and easy to use with web UI to view the test 
 results. Let's make load testing quick and easy with LocustIO.
